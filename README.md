# Patternfly components for Yew

This is little more than a PoC right now.

Thing to do are:

* [X] Modularize (lib and starter project) -> [ctron/patternfly-yew-quickstart](https://github.com/ctron/patternfly-yew-quickstart)
* [ ] Add much more components
* [X] Add `yew-router` support
* [ ] Provide documentation

## Example project

Take a look at:

  * https://ctron.github.io/patternfly-yew-quickstart
  * https://github.com/ctron/patternfly-yew-quickstart
