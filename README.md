# Patternfly starter for Yew

This is little more than a PoC right now.

Thing to do are:

* [X] Modularize (lib and starter project) -> [ctron/patternfly-yew-quickstart](https://github.com/ctron/patternfly-yew-quickstart)
* [ ] Add much more components
* [X] Add `yew-router` support
* [ ] Provide documentation

## Pre-requisites

* Cargo `wasm-pack`

      cargo install wasm-pack

* NodeJS `npm`

## Run local developer setup

    npm run start:dev
