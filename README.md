# Patternfly starter for Yew

This isn't more than a PoC right now.

Thing to do are:

* [ ] Modularize (lib and starter project)
* [ ] Add much more components
* [ ] Provide documentation

## Pre-requisites

* Cargo `wasm-pack`

      cargo install wasm-pack

* NodeJS `npm`

## Run local developer setup

    npm run start:dev
